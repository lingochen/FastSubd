- <s>Loop/MBFly subdivision using PolyMesh halfEdge.</s> @done(2022/04/09), proof of concept 
     - except for attributes, which needs to be refactored.
     - reuse attribute like vertex.

- <s>Holes management in PolyMesh/TriMesh. (why? easier to select boundary edges as group)</s> @done(2022/05/26)
     - add HoleArray handling.
     - subdivide holes handling. 
     - properly account for unused slot.

- <s>Support Boundary and Crease.</s> @done (2022/06/26, catmull-clark, loop) schemes, skip modified butterfly.
     - <s>boundary edge</s>
     - <s>crease edge/vertex</s>

- webworker parallel subidivision support. 

- investigated reconsider how to represent attributes.

- Displaced Subdivision Surface.

- GLSL shader.

- Quad/Tri subdivision scheme
